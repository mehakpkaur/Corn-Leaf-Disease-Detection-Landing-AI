## Project Overview

This project focuses on the automatic classification of maize (corn) leaf images into different disease categories using the **Landing AI platform**.  
It aims to assist in **early disease detection**, which is crucial for improving crop yield and reducing agricultural losses.

The model classifies leaves into the following categories:
- **Healthy**
- **Common Rust**
- **Gray Leaf Spot**
- **Blight**

---

## Methodology

The workflow followed in this project includes:

1. **Data Collection** – Gathering maize leaf images from standard datasets  
2. **Data Labelling** – Categorizing images into disease classes  
3. **Model Training** – Training an image classification model using Landing AI  
4. **Model Testing** – Evaluating predictions on unseen images  
5. **Deployment** – Making the model accessible via QR-based interface

## Input / Output

- **Input:** Image of a corn leaf (uploaded or captured using a mobile device)
- **Output:** Predicted disease category with classification result  

Sample predictions are shown in the poster above.

---

## Outcome

Users can:
1. Upload or capture a leaf image  
2. Scan the provided QR code  
3. Submit the image for analysis  
4. Instantly view the predicted disease class  

The model achieves **~90% accuracy on sample test images**, effectively distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves.

## Results

- Correct classification for the majority of test samples  
- Minor misclassification observed between visually similar disease patterns  
- Demonstrates the practical applicability of AI in agriculture
